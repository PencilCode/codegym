<code>img</code> is an HTML tag that you can use inside your
<code>write</code> blocks.  The <code>src</code> attribute is set
to the name of the image file you want to include.

<code class="jumbo">write '&lt;img src="<span data-dfn="image file name">/img/red-dragon</span>"&gt;'</code>

When you write HTML files on the web, you can include images from
anywhere online.  Here, you can use images in the special "/img/" directory
that provides a large number of reusable images from around the web.
Try any file name you like.  Here are a few that work:
