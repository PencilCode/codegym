<code>img</code> is an HTML tag that you can use to put an image into your HTML document.
The <code>src</code> attribute is set to the name of the image file you want to include.

<code class="jumbo">&lt;img src="<span data-dfn="image query">/img/dragon</span>"&gt;</code>

This searches google images for the first image result given your query.

When you write HTML files on the web, you can also just include images from anywhere online.
<pre class="jumbo" style="font-size:20px">
&lt;img src=
"<span data-dfn="image file URL">http://beyondheroes2.zxq.net/BlackDragon.jpg</span>"&gt;</pre>
Want to resize your image? There's an attribute for that!</br>
Add in <code>height='50' width='50'</code> inside your tag, to resize it.</br>
<b>height</b>, and <b>width</b> are attributes of the img tag. They set the size.
