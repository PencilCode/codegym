  motions in reverse order.  Can you use this trick
  to complete a symmetric pattern for a shirt?

  - title: Add Color
    subtitle: finish the drawing with style
    mission: >
      Tailor your shirt as you like, or fill in the color.
      You might want to experiment with <code>pen path</code> and
      <code>fill</code> to make other clothes or design a
      fabric pattern.  Use symmetry or be creative!
