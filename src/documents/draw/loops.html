title: Repeated Patterns
subtitle: using for to automatically repeat code
mission: >
  Drawings with repeated patterns can be created using <code>for</code>.
  To repeat a piece of code three times, the code to be repeated
  should be indented neatly under <code>for [1..3]</code>.
  Try changing this program to repeat the code five or six times,
  or just once or twice.
instructions:
  - title: Numbered Dots
    subtitle: using a loop variable
    mission: >
      Try numbering each dot by adding a loop variable
      <code>x</code>.  Change the loop to say <code>for x in [1..6]</code>.
      Then after drawing a dot, add the command <code>label x</code>.
      What is the value of <code>x</code> each time the code repeats?
  - title: Beaded Bracelets
    subtitle: adding more beads
    mission: >
      How would we make a bracelet with more than six beads?
      When the turtle makes a full circle, it will make a total
      of 360 degrees of turns.  With six beads, that is 360/6=60
      degrees per bead. For twenty beads, that would be 360/20=18
      degrees per bead.
