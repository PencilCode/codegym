title: Complex Repetitions
subtitle: nesting loops
mission: >
  Intricate effects can be created by nesting <code>for</code> loops
  inside other <code>for</code> loops.  Experiment with adding
  more colors or numbers to the outer or inner loops.  How many
  shapes are drawn when you change the repetitions?
  Try changing the arrangement of the shapes.

    subtitle: different each time
    mission: >
      <em>Loop variables</em> stand for different values each time the
      loop is run.  <code>c</code> goes through different colors.
      <code>sides</code> and <code>x</code> go through different numbers.
      How would you use a loop variable to label each corner with a
      different number?
