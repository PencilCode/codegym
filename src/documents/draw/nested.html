title: Complex Repetitions
subtitle: nesting loops
blocks: true
mission: >
  Intricate effects can be created by nesting <code>for</code> loops
  inside other <code>for</code> loops.  What happens when you add
  more colors or numbers to the outer or inner loops?  How many
  shapes are drawn when you change the repetitions?
  Can you change the arrangement of the shapes?

  - title: Loop Variables
    subtitle: different each time
    mission: >
      <em>Loop variables</em> stand for different values each time the
      loop is run.  <code>c</code> goes through different colors.
      <code>sides</code> and <code>x</code> go through different numbers.
      How would you use a loop variable to label each corner with a
      different number?
