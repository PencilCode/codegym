title: Draw a Snowkid
subtitle: move forward with fd
mission: >
  What happens when you draw a huge dot of size 1000?
  Once you have a <code>thistle</code> background, you
  can see <code>snow</code> dots.
  If you make a few snow dots in different places,
  you can draw a little snow person.  The <code>fd</code>
  command can be used to move the turtle.
instructions:
  - title: Add Decorations
    subtitle: move backwards with bk
    mission: >
      The turtle can be moved backward with <code>bk</code>.
      Try moving it back and adding a few buttons or a nose.
  - title: Add a Face
    subtitle: turn with rt and lt
    mission: >
      The turtle can turned right with <code>rt</code> and
      left with <code>lt</code>.  Try adding eyes or a few
      dots for a smile.  To explore another example with
      a smiley face, take a look at <a href="smiley.html">Making
      Commands</a>.
