title: Line Techniques
mission: >
  <code>pen</code> tells the turtle to trace out a
  <a href="/ref/colors.html" target="reference">colored</a>
  line as it moves.  Can you find an interesting pen color?
  There are <a href="/ref/colors.html"
  target="reference">140 color names</a> including most common
  color names like <code>red</code> and <code>blue</code> and
  <code>black</code>, plus some unusual ones like <code>gold</code>,
  <code>seagreen</code>, <code>aquamarine</code>, and <code>rosybrown</code>.

  - title: Pen Thickness
    mission: >
      Using a comma, you can add a number which is the pen thickness,
      in pixels: <code>pen red, 10</code>.  What does a really thick
      line look like?
  - title: Angles
    mission: >
      You can experiment with turning the line in a different direction.
      The <a href="/ref/rt.html" target="reference">rt</a>
      and <a href="/ref/rt.html" target="reference">lt</a>
      commands can pivot the turtle in a new direction, like
      <code>rt 90</code> or <code>lt 135</code>.  If you combine
      several lines and angles, youc can make a shape.
  - title: Speed
    mission: >
      Would you like to draw faster or slower? You can use
      the command <code>speed 10</code> to tell the turtle
      to do 10 moves per second.
