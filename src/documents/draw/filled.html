blocks: true
mission: >
  Fill shapes using an invisible "path" pen with <code>pen path</code>,
  and then using the <code>fill</code> command when the path is complete
  to fill that path with a color.  This program defines a <em>function</em>
  called <code>moon</code> to trace out the shape.

    subtitle: explore functions
    mission: >
      To outline a filled shape, you need to draw the shape twice,
      once with <code>pen path</code> and <code>fill</code>, and
      once with a normal colored pen.  Can you use <code>do moon</code>
      twice to do this?
