title: Straight Line Shapes
subtitle: lines and angles
mission: >
  By combining <code>pen</code>, <code>fd</code>, <code>rt</code>,
  and <code>lt</code>, we can make lines and angles, and we can
  create any straight-line shape.  This sailboat could be
  customized with different sizes or colors; or you can
  erase it and make a different shape like a stop-sign or a house.
