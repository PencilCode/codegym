  A <em>function</em> is just a subprogram that you can make by
  indenting your program after an arrow <code>-&gt;</code>.
  If you name your functions with a definition like
  <code>smiley = -&gt;</code>, you can use your function anywhere
  with <code>do smiley</code>.  If you move the turtle, you
  can make a page with several smileys.

    mission: >
      You can define different functions to help make a richer scene.
      Can you customize your smiley function to give it a specific
      personality?  Can you functions for other characters?
