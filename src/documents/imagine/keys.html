    mission: >
      When your player does something that you want to keep 
      track of (like finding an important key) you can use a 
      variable to make sure you remember that that happened. 
      What other important items might your player find?
  - title: Remember other information
    mission: >
      true and false are special values, called booleans.
      Variables can store other things, though -- for example,
      numbers! Maybe you have to ask the troll three times 
      before she'll let you cross the bridge...
