title: Tempo
subtitle: from Happy by Pharrell Williams
mission: >
  Pharrell William's Happy has an uptempo, catchy beat,
  but this program plays it too slowly.  Experiment with
  the tempo of the song and see if you can find the right
  speed.

  - title: Variables
    subtitle: musical algebra
    mission: >
      This program sets up variables to represent entire lines of
      the song Happy.  Variables need to be defined before you ask
      the computer to `play` them.  What happens if you reorder
      or add variables?
  - title: Extend the Tune
    subtitle: can you play Happy?
    mission: >
      Try extending the the tune and make your own
      question-and-answer melodies.
      It takes a good ear and a lot of experimentation
      to create a catchy riff!
