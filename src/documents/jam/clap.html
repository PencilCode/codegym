title: Clapping
subtitle: playing different timbre
mission: >
  To play with a sound other than a piano, change the waveform
  used.  The <code>timbre</code> option on play lets you
  create an instrument sound from a few numbers.  Experiment
  by changing the numbers in clapsound.

      Which songs have you already played that could benefit
      from some clapping rhythm?  How would you add these sounds
      to your songs?
  - title: Synthesizing Sounds
    subtitle: using different waveforms
    mission: >
      The <code>'noise'</code> waveform is good for percussive
      sounds.  To make a tonal sound, use the <code>'square'</code>,
      <code>'sawtooth'</code>, <code>'triangle'</code>, or
      <code>'sine'</code> waves.  Experiment with waveforms.
      Try creating a <code>Piano</code> with a custom
      <code>timbre</code>.
