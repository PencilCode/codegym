title: Clapping
subtitle: playing different timbre
mission: >
  To play with a sound other than a piano, change the waveform
  used.  The <code>timbre</code> option on play lets you
  create an instrument sound from a few numbers.  Experiment
  by changing the numbers in clapsound.

    mission: >
      Which songs have you already played that could benefit
      from some clapping rhythm?  How would you add these sounds
      to your songs?
  - title: Synthesizing Sounds
    subtitle: using different waveforms
    mission: >
      The <code>'noise'</code> waveform is good for percussive
      sounds.  To make a tonal sound, use the <code>'square'</code>,
      <code>'sawtooth'</code>, <code>'triangle'</code>, or
      <code>'sine'</code> waves.  Experiment with waveforms.
      Try creating a <code>Piano</code> with a custom
      <code>timbre</code>.
