    mission: >
      The <code>play</code> command normally sequences things
      so that the next song waits until this previous one is finished.
      To play sounds without forcing sequencing, you can either
      use the "wait" option: <code>play {wait: false}, "CDE"</code>,
      or you can use the <code>tone</code> function.
