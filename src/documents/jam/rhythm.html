  To make a rhythm with multiple instruments, create a
  different object to play each instrument.  Here we
  just create an an image of the instrument and tell it to play.

    subtitle: using different waveforms
    mission: >
      The <code>'noise'</code> waveform is good for percussive
      sounds.  To make a tonal sound, use the <code>'square'</code>,
      <code>'sawtooth'</code>, <code>'triangle'</code>, or
      <code>'sine'</code> waves.  Experiment with waveforms.
