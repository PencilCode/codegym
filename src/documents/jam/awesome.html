  Tegan and Sara's <em>Everything is AWESOME</em> uses alternating 8-note
  intervals called <a href="/ref/octaves.html" target="reference">octaves</a>
  for a steady, alert rhythm.  Use <code>,</code> to indicate an octave
  below middle C and <code>'</code> to play an octave above.
  Add several commas in a row.   How might you improve this song using
