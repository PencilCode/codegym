subtitle: why dont you tag along?
mission: >
  Creating a website is easy!
  Content in HTML is wrapped by tags which are used to describe the content.</br>
  There are many tags to learn, so check the references!
refs: ['img']
instructions:
  - title: The <img> Tag
    subtitle: the sky's the limit! wait, no..
    mission: >
      Most markup tags are used for formatting text, and some find that
      interesting. Let's play with images instead.</br>
      Use the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to put a cool image onto your page!
      Just change the tag like so: <code>&lt;img src='/img/<b>[Add anything here!]</b>'&gt;</code>
  - title: Attributes
    subtitle: this is an attribute to you..
    mission: >
      HTML tags all have attributes. <code>src=''</code> is actually an
      attribute of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.</br> <code>width</code>
      and <code>height</code> are also attributes of the
      <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.
      Add the <code>width</code> attribute inside your <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>
      tag to resize it like so : <code>&lt;img width='50px' src='/img/bird'&gt;</code>
  - title: Hyper-Text-Markup-Language
    subtitle: it's all in the name
    mission: >
      So as you probably have noticed, ther'es an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag around the text.</br>
      There are actually many other tags to format your text. Try changing to the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></br>
      tag to see the difference. See the text reference.
  - title: HTML Positioning
    subtitle: finding your center
    mission : >
      Now you know how to put elements onto a page and resize them, but how do you position them?</br>
      Use the <code>&lt;center&gt;</code> tag to center your other elements. Try this :</br>
      <code>&lt;center&gt;everything else!&lt;/center&gt;</code>
  - title: The <body> Tag
    subtitle: it's alive!
    mission: > 
      The <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag is usually used to contain all the content on a page.</br>
      This is useful if you want to apply some property to your entire document.
